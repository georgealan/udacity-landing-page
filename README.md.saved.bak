# Udacity Landing Page Project

Link to the online version: [https://georgealan.github.io/udacity-landing-page/](https://georgealan.github.io/udacity-landing-page/)



This is a landing page project built with HTML, CSS, and VanillaJS. The main objective of this project was to practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript. I decided to create a video slide in the background and a photo gallery with image previews, without using external plugins or jQuery. Everything was done with vanillaJS. I wanted to go beyond the project requirements and add some additional features to practice JavaScript.

Three functionalities that I included in the project are:
1. The hero section with a video slide in the background.
1. A horse breeds section where the text is loaded from a .json file.
1. A photo gallery with image previews.

All these functionalities were implemented using vanillaJS, without relying on external plugins or jQuery.

### Usage of JSON files:
I used .json files to provide text content for certain sections of the site, simulating an API. The text for the hero section's video slide and the horse breeds section are both sourced from .json files using JavaScript's fetch API.
