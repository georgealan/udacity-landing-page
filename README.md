# Udacity Landing Page Project

Link to the online version: [https://georgealan.github.io/udacity-landing-page/](https://georgealan.github.io/udacity-landing-page/)



This is a landing page project built with HTML, CSS, and VanillaJS. The main objective of this project was to practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript. I decided to create a video slide in the background and a photo gallery with image previews, without using external plugins or jQuery. Everything was done with vanillaJS. I wanted to go beyond the project requirements and add some additional features to practice JavaScript.
