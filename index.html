                    <h2>Racing Shires</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first recorded Shire race in the UK took place in 2013 and was won by Joey, ridden by Mark Grant. 
                        The race is now an annual event, with Clydesdales also taking part. These events are showcases for 
                        these lovely animals and provide great family entertainment.

                    <h2>Considered by many to be the supreme draft horse, this “gentle giant” has a straight action and a kind disposition.</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Shire got its name in 1884 from the Midland “shires” (counties) of Lincoln, Leicester, Stafford, 
                        and Derby, where it was originally bred, and may have its origins in England’s Great Horse, although 
                        the connection cannot be proven. When the Great Horses were no longer required in warfare, they were 
                        put to work in the farms, eventually developing into powerful draft horses. These horses were improved 
                        by various outcrosses, with the heavy Flemish, or Flanders, horse being the most influential. 
                        During the 16th and early 17th centuries, Dutch contractors draining the English fenlands imported 
                        these strong horses, which later bred with the local horses. Another import, the Friesian (see pp.164–65) 
                        had a refining effect and produced a freer movement.
                        The foundation stallion of the Shire is the Packington Blind Horse who sired numerous colts between 
                        1755 and 1770. The English Cart Horse Society was formed in 1876 and produced the first studbook two 
                        years later. It became the Shire Horse Society in 1884. The American Shire Horse Association was 
                        created in 1885. The modern Shire is more like the type developed in the Midlands than the coarser 
                        Fen strains. Its powerful musculature exemplify the strong structure of an ideal draft horse. 
                        While the Shire no longer plays a major role in agriculture, it participates in plowing matches. 
                        In cities, it can occasionally be seen hauling laden brewers’ wagons and drawing coaches in street parades.
